## Install

Download the complete folder and run it on your server (for example MAMP, LAMP or WAMP). 

It has to be a server because data assets are JSON files that are loaded Ajax, and browsers have sercurity restrictions when running from file://.

##Improve it!

Make new levels editing data/level.json file or by creating a new one.

##Thanks
